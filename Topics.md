# Potential Projects for Competition 2
## Spring 2019

For the purpose of familiarizing you with data mining modeling techniques, as well as preparing you for topic selection of your capstone project, I have carefully selected the following topics for competition 2. These topics cover fields including _finance_, _social media_, and _marketing analytics_. Also, these topics range from __classification__ to __regression__ as modeling objectives. 

Each group is asked to provide their ranking of the following topics. For instance, one group can rank the topics as __Topic 1__, __Topic 3__, __Topic 2__. The topic with the highest ranking will be selected as the topic for competition 2.  

Please use [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/XYey4DVjuZBVYeZ83) to rank these topics.

## Topics:
+ __Topic 1__: [Default of Credit Card Clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

In this project, you are going to predict if a credit card client is going to make a [default payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)) using a set of demographic and financial information of the client. This is a classification project (although __regression models__ can be used in it).

This dataset contains 23 continuous or categorical features, and 1 binary target (default or not). The dataset can be downloaded using this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls).

+ __Topic 2__: [Online News Popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity)

In this project, you are going to predict how popular a piece of online news can be using different features of the news, e.g., _content_, _category_, _keyword_, _topic_. The original dataset is based on a regression problem - the __target variable__, _shares_, is the number of shares for a particular online news article. Although this can be converted into a classification project (popular/neutral/unpopular) by binning the original target.

This dataset contains 60 continuous or categorical features, and 1 continuous target (_shares_). The dataset can be downloaded using this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00332/OnlineNewsPopularity.zip). If this project is selected, I will provide the decompressed data files.

+ __Topic 3__: [Bank Tele-marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

In this project, you are going to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit, using the information from a direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. This is a classification project (although __regression models__ can be used in it).

This dataset contains 20 continuous or categorical features, and 1 binary target (subscribe or not). The dataset can be downloaded using this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank-additional.zip). This data set contains a full file (which you will use to train and evaluate your model(s)) and a much smaller sample (10% random sample, which you can use to train complicated models such as SVM or random forest). If this project is selected, I will provide the decompressed data files.
