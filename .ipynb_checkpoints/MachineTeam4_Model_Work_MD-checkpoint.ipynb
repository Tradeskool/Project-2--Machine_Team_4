    "## C. Business Understanding:\n",
    "Online shopping is an important revenue source for many retail businesses, such as our client. According to Sakar et al. (2019), desipte increases in e-commerce traffic in the recent past, \"conversion\" (of browsers to purchasers) has not increased proportionately. Indeed, the dataset includes 12,330 \"sessions,\" of which only 1908 (15.5%) resulted in conversion (Sakar et al. 2019, 6895). Thus, it is very important for retail companies, such as our client, to better understand - in real time - the cues that drive conversion. Complicating the process is that unlike \"brick and mortar\" stores where shoppers can interact with salespeople who, in turn, can help to facilitate (or at least understand) customer conversion on the basis of their interaction, online retail businesses must *infer* customer behavior from other cues. But, what are those cues for our client? As part of determining whether a \"browser\" will become a \"purchaser,\" our client also might like to know about the cues suggesting the opposite behavior - i.e., abandoning the site or the shopping cart. Additionally, the client might like to know why customers purchasing competitors' products fail to visit their website. On the basis of our models, our client is interested in knowing what we might suggest doing (in real time) to increase conversion/reduce abandonment. Further our client might also like to know if we believe there are other factors that have not been captured in the dataset that might be helpful in better predicting conversion/abandonment in the future as well as figuring out how to attract to the client's websitem consumers who make purchases on competitors' websites.\n",

    "### Observations for Preliminary EDA/Visualizations:\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Warnings – highlights:**\n",
    "    -High correlation between Exit Rates and BounceRates, which we noted in the correlation map.\n",
    "    -Dataset has 125 duplicate rows, which we decided to allow given that there are no unique identifiers that we could use to verify whether the apparently duplicate entries (~1% of the data) were bogus or legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Variables – highlights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Administrative is a count between 0 and 27; it is right skewed (with ~66% of the dataset in 0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    - Administrative_duration captures time spent; it also is right skewed with almost 50% of the data being zero (which makes sense because almost 50% of the data in Administrative is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Informational is a count between 0 and 24; it is right skewed (with ~90% of the dataset in 0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    - Informational_duration captures time spent; it also is right skewed with over 80% of the data being zero (which makes sense because over 78% of the data in Informational is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ProductRelated is a count between 0 and 705; it is right skewed (however; only ~12% of the dataset is in 0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    - ProductRelated_duration captures time spent; it also is right skewed with almost 6% of the data being zero (which makes sense because only 12% of the data in ProductRelated is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - BounceRate captures the percentage of visits in which a visitor exits the landing page without browsing any further. It is right skewed, with about 45% of the data being a value of 0. Given that those who “bounce” will certainly not buy, this attribute may well be an important variable in our model. (Note: ExitRate, which is highly correlated with BounceRate, also is likely to have a similar skewness, distribution and importance in predicting online shoppers’ purchasing behavior.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - PageValues are dollar amounts – more or less – amounting to sales amounts, divided by page views. The variable is right skewed with approximately 78% of PageValues being zero; this makes sense because about 45% of customers “bounce” immediately, buying nothing, leaving another ~30% to browse without completing a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SpecialDay is a binary variable with 0 for not near a holiday/special day and 1 for near a holiday/special day. The variable is right skewed with approximately 90% of the data being zero (i.e., transaction not occurring near a holiday/special day). This information suggests to us that we are dealing with a unique retail environment (i.e., most retailers experience increased activity at/during holiday times).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Month – is the month of the year in which the transaction occurred. We first noted that the dataset is devoid of transactions in January and April. Thus, the dataset does not appear to contain a full year of information, which could impair our ability to complete the analysis in light of potential seasonality. The most popular months for online browsing/shopping are: May (27.3%), November (24.3%), March (15.5%) and December 14.0%). Low months include: June-October, perhaps because           folks are not browsing/shopping online during the warmer months.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - OperatingSystems – is a categorical variable and most of the data (~95%) is in one of three operating systems (2, 1, 3). \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Browser – is a categorical variable and most the data (~91%) come from three browsers (2, 1, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Region – is a categorical variable for the region from which the visitor came. The top four account for ~77% of the data (i.e., regions 1, 3, 4, 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - TrafficType – is a categorical variable to indicate how the visitor arrived at the website. The top three account for approximately 67% of the referrals (i.e., types 2, 1, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - VisitorType – is a categorical variable. Most visitors (~86%) are return visitors. A few visitors have been classified as “Other”; however, they should not be so classified as the categories of “Returning_visitor” and “New_visitor” should capture all visitors (i.e., a visitor is either one or the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Weekend – is a categorical variable to capture whether the visitor is visiting the site on a weekend. Approximately 77% of the visits took place during the week, which makes sense in light of the proportion of weekdays in a week (i.e., 5/7 = 71.4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Revenue – is the target variable. It is a categorical variable. It is imbalanced – as approximately 85% of the visits resulted in “no sale” (i.e., only ~15% of the visits resulted in sales). As such, we will need to balance the data later.\n"
